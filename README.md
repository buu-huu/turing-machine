# Turing Machine
Python implementation of the turing machine.

### Info
The current development state doesn't have any CLI. Just review the code and implement it in your project as you need it.

### Installation
The program does not need to be installed. You just need to install PyQt5 by executing the following command.

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And then, run the program:

```bash
cd src
python turing.py
```

Info: You need to use Python 3. Maybe you have to use the command `python3` instead of `python`.
